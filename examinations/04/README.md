# Examination 4 - Install a Web Server

Now that we know how to install software on a machine through Ansible, we can
begin to look at how to set up a machine with services.

A typical use case is how to get a web server up and running, and coincidentally
we happen to have one of our hosts named `webserver`.

As in the previous examination, we can use the [ansible.builtin.package](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html)
module to install the prerequisite software.

Create a new file, you can call it what you like, but in the example below, it's referred to as
`webserver.yml`.

    ---
    - name: Install a webserver
      hosts: web
      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Ensure nginx is installed
          ansible.builtin.package:
            name: nginx
            state: latest

        - name: Ensure nginx is started at boot
          ansible.builtin.service:
            name: nginx
            enabled: true

The above is a playbook that will install [nginx](https://nginx.org/), a piece of software that can
act as a HTTP server, reverse proxy, content cache, load balancer, and more.

Now, we can run `curl` to see if web server does what we want it to (serve HTTP pages on TCP port 80):

    $ curl -v http://<IP ADDRESS OF THE WEBSERVER>

Change the text within '<' and '>' to the actual IP address of the web server. It may work with the
name of the server too, but this depends on how `libvirt` and DNS is set up on your machine.

Is the response what we expected?

    $ curl -v http://192.168.121.10
    *   Trying 192.168.121.10:80...
    * connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 from 192.168.121.1 port 46036 failed: Connection refused
    * Failed to connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 after 0 ms: Could not connect to server
    * closing connection #0
    curl: (7) Failed to connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 after 0 ms: Could not connect to server

# QUESTION A

Refer to the documentation for the [ansible.builtin.service](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/service_module.html)
module.

How can we make the web server start with an addition of just one line to the playbook above?

A: We didnt epcify it should start right away.If we run -vvv we can see it says "ActiveState":"inactive" so it doesnt really start at any point, its just installed. We proabbly need to ad an active state such as "state: started" 

# QUESTION B

You make have noted that the `become: true` statement has moved from a specific task to the beginning
of the playbook, and is on the same indentation level as `tasks:`.

What does this accomplish?

A: It determines if 1 task or every task inside one play will run as sudo/root. In our case we do not have to repeat become:true since we have it up in task level indentation.

# QUESTION C

Copy the above playbook to a new playbook. Call it `04-uninstall-webserver.yml`.

Change the ordering of the two tasks. Make the web server stop, and disable it from starting at boot, and
make sure that `nginx` is uninstalled. Change the `name:` parameter of each task accordingly.

Run the new playbook, then make sure that the web server is not running (you can use `curl` for this), and
log in to the machine and make sure that there are no `nginx` processes running.

Why did we change the order of the tasks in the `04-uninstall-webserver.yml` playbook?

A: We want to make sure there are no conflicts so we have to stop and disable the service before attempting to remove/uninstall it.

# BONUS QUESTION

Consider the output from the tasks above, and what we were actually doing on the machine.

What is a good naming convention for tasks? (What SHOULD we write in the `name:` field`?)

A: We are installing and removing and perhaps other times updating things, so its important to have clear concise and coherent structure in the naming. So Install/Uninstall/Update as name and task as Ensure X is started/enabled | stopped/disabled. So other users easily can understand and take over projects smoothly.
